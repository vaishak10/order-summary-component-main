## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the first time that I have developed a UI template following the mobile first design approach.<br>
Also developed responsive design using pure css with the help of media queries.

### Continued development

Some responsive issue for some devices. Still working on making this design responsive for all the devices. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS properties](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/) - Best place for explanation of all CSS properties available along with examples.
